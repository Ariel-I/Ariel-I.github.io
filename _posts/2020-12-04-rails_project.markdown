Well this one was a doozy to say the least. Learning rails has been really exciting but also very difficult. There are just SO many things rails can do. After working with vanilla Sinatra it seems like rails has an endless amount of magic available. It was only after writing my “Santa’s Workshop Rails App” that I was truly exposed to the magic. That being said, the magic wasn’t always helpful. There were so many times that I would add new code and break something somewhere else because I didn’t understand the full scope of how much magic was being created. It took a little while, but I began really understanding the methods used and where everything was going (aka flow). 


Project weeks always feel like they go by way too fast. What I have come to learn though, is that as hard as the project may seem I always come out at the end of the week with a working app, a load of anxiety lifted from my chest, and having learned a TON. As much as the lessons prepare you, actually coding an app from begin to end is a whole different beast. 


I was nervous about this project because it seemed so huge and I worried I would never fully understand ‘joins tables.’ As is turns out, and like every developer I know has said, the repetition that comes with coding really does help set it in your mind. I created my Santa’s Workshop app but only after beginning an app about astrology. I didn’t get too far before changing my mind but rewriting the code helped me understand more clearly the paths I needed to take at least for the first little bit. I even decided that I’m going to follow through with building my astrology app in my free time for extra experience! I didn’t expect to enjoy coding as much as I do now and I think the further we get with our projects the more exciting it becomes. In the end I had a lot of fun (in between anxiety driven hours of coding) and am looking forward to the next project.
