I've made it to the second project in Flatirons curriculum and WOW does time fly! I feel like it was just yesterday I was brainstorming ideas for the CLI project and now I’m sitting down with a cup of tea and a finished Sinatra project just one month later. This project, like the last, was daunting as first but as I began to build my ‘RESTful’ routes everything seemed to fit together well and render pages nicely. 

The most exciting parts of this project are really the ability to see coded data presented as an actual web route. After days of building, second guessing, and full on frustration I’m happy to say I actually had a lot of fun building this app. I can’t get my cohort leads voice out of my head saying, “render a page, redirect to a route” and I’m honestly ok with it! At first, MVC’s seemed really complicated but with the CRUD options worked in, “models, views, and controllers” came to make just as much sense as peanut butter and jelly! Create, read, update, and destroy were my bigger issues. Read and destroy were super straightforward but the routes for creating and updating gave me more issues. The thing about coding that I have come to realize is that the little things really DO matter. I found myself looking for ‘=’ signs and missing but necessary plurals while debugging and most often those little, tiny things would fix my error codes. Now I’m having to teach my self to slow down typing but also maintain a decent programming speed. Such a paradox!

Now that I have a working  app, I feel confident to move forward into the depths Rails as Sinatra is such a lightweight framework. Brewery Buddy was a fun app to build and the concept of saving my favorite beers from my favorite breweries will stay with me next time I go for a good beer tasting but for now I’m happy to have completed the project and look forward to diving further into full stack web development!
